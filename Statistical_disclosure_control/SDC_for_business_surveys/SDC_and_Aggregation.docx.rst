Summary
~~~~~~~

The specification covers data aggregation and statistical disclosure
control. Initially the data are to be aggregated to create magnitude
tables.

**Aggregation**

The Aggregation method has three stages to produce 4 required values for
any given cell.

The 4 values that are generated by the Aggregation Method are:

1. A value representing a count of the number of values that have been
   aggregated for that cell

2. A value representing the sum of the values that have been aggregated
   for that cell

3. A value representing the Top Value recorded in the aggregation
   process for that cell

4. A value representing the second Top value recorded in the aggregation
   process for that cell

**Statistical Disclosure Control**

Following aggregation, Statistical disclosure control (SDC) is applied.
This aims to ensure that as much detailed information as possible is
published while at the same time minimising the risk of disclosing
information on individuals, households, businesses or other units.

The use of SDC is a legal requirement for business statistics with the
aim being to find a satisfactory balance between confidentiality and
risk. When publishing, there is always an element of disclosure risk
unless outputs of extremely limited use are published.

The method described enables the application of statistical disclosure
control (SDC) to magnitude tables. Each cell in the table will consist
of the sum of a variable such as Turnover or the total import / export
value for all the businesses or statistical units which are members of
that cell.

Information may be disclosed due to:

-  **Low numbers of contributors in a cell in a table. At the simplest
   level if there are 2 contributors, each will know the value of the
   other if the cell total is published.**

-  **One or two businesses being particularly dominant within a cell. If
   they contribute a large proportion towards the cell total, relative
   to all of the other businesses belonging to that cell another
   contributor to the cell, or an external intruder, may be able to work
   out an individual contribution to within a small margin of error by
   using the published cell total.**

The application of SDC at its most reductive can be considered a 3-stage
process:

-  Assessment of the risk in magnitude tables: which cells are
   problematic due to low numbers of contributors in the cell and/or a
   dominant contributor. The rules are set at this stage.

-  Identification of disclosive cells by applying the rules to each cell
   in the table.

-  Protecting the table to enable publication. Suppression of cells
   defined as disclosive (primary suppression) and other cells to avoid
   disclosure by differencing (secondary suppression) and/or redesign
   the table.

Methodology is described both for cases when all responses are positive
and for when there is a combination of positive and negative responses.
It is to be applied to tables of magnitude values, typically a cell in
the table is a summation of value such as turnover relating to one or
more businesses.

**Strengths**

SDC is to be applied to many standard outputs from business surveys.
There are more steps described here than in previous disclosure control
methodologies which should enable more data to be published. The aim is
to allow for additional protection given by factors such rounding of
outputs and the presence of estimated values which were not considered
in the classical approach.

Much of the process including the application of rules to define whether
a cell is disclosive and secondary can be carried out by the Tau-Argus
program.

**Limitations**

-  This method is not suitable for frequency tales. It is also not
   applicable to non-tabular business outputs such as times series.

-  Disclosure control will not be required if all businesses or units in
   the data have agreed that their results can be published even if
   disclosive. This is usually assisted by the implementation of
   waivers.

-  This method may also not be applicable if the underlying microdata
   has had disclosure control applied. In that case any tables produced
   should be publishable following basic checks.

-  There is limited functionality when protecting linked tables, tables
   with a common row or column.

**Alternative Methods**

If the data are released under licence to a small number of users,
little or no disclosure control will be necessary.

Requirements and Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Tabulation and SDC are applied to tables at the end of the production
process. Specifications for standard publications such as table
structure are determined in advance.

The standard steps in the statistical business process model (edit and
imputation, calculation of weights) are followed to produce the required
tables. At the final stage prior to producing tables for publication the
Aggregation and SDC algorithm is utilised. Following a successful
application, the data can be published.

For ad hoc requests, a similar process is followed although the
relationship between the requested publication(s) and previous releases
should be examined to ensure outputs cannot be differenced to find out
disclosive values.

Assumptions and Validity
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It should be assumed that SDC is necessary for the outputs as previously
stated near the end of the production process. If all the businesses or
statistical units have agreed to their data being published (i.e.
waivers have been implemented), even if disclosive then SDC need not be
carried out.

If a proportion of businesses have agreed to this this should be
indicated in the input data.

A table prepared for publication. Details of the top contributors to
each cell will also be required.

The exact input format required will depend on the code used to carry
out SDC has been written.

Flow charts for positive only and positive/negative responses can be
found in these links. These charts show the approach to follow for
identifying disclosive cells.

**Detailed Methodology**

More detail on the Input and Output requirements and the method of
disclosure control can be found here.

Worked Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A worked example of the mixed positive/negatives values flowchart can be
found in this link. This covers the stage consisting of Identifying
disclosive cells in the table.

Examples of how to protect the table, using suppression and table
redesign, following the identification of these cells can be found in
the document referenced in the Method Specification section.

Scenarios to be Tested
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Can linked tables be protected? Carry out secondary suppression on
   multiple table which share a variable. Protecting two tables may work
   but there might be issue with secondary suppression when suppressing
   more tables.

-  Can the methodology be adapted for batch processing of tables rather
   than applying disclosure control to each table separately?

Treatment of Special Cases
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Most publications will need to be consistent with those from previous
   years. If the cells are disclosive each year then the secondary
   suppression pattern should also remain the same.

-  Ad hoc publication request will need to be checked alongside regular
   publications to ensure that disclosure by differencing is not an
   issue. As an example, a request for a Geography variable with
   non-standard categories could result in data for a small area being
   published.

-  Table publication. If there is no secondary suppression solution
   obtainable in a specified length of time, then either recode the
   table as described or do not publish.

Example (Synthetic) Data 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*This section should contain links to synthetic input and output data*

.. _section-4:

Code
~~~~

*To be completed after implementation, this section should:*

-  *Provide a link to the implementing code in the SML repository.*

-  *Provide code examples demonstrating how to call a method. Typically
   these would cover each of the four supported languages: Java, Python,
   R and Scala.*

Issues for Consideration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Detail any relevant considerations to be aware of that havenât been
covered in the rest of the specification.*

Links

**Background**

1. This handbook gives technical advice on all aspects of disclosure
   control not just tabular outputs. It will be of use to those with an
   interest in any area of data confidentiality.

   are protected. Disclosure control methodology is mentioned but there
   is not the level of technical detail that is available in the SML
   documentation. It is currently being revised.

**Secondary Suppression**

After finding the disclosive cells, one method of completing the
protection of the table is to apply secondary suppression.
